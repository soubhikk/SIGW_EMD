This repository contains code files relevant to the article 'Towards a Complete Treatment of Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves with Early Matter Domination' by Soubhik Kumar, Hanwen Tai, and Lian-Tao Wang.
It contains pre-computed kernels for a given cosmological history which can be used to compute the strength of the gravitational wave background for any primordial curvature perturbation.
